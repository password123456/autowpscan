An automated tool that automatically scanning a list of multiple websites with wordpress at once. and send scan summary to telegram with wpscan logs.

Requires wpscan, Telegram BOT Token, WordPress Vulnerability Database API token


## Introduction
This tool takes a list of multiple websites created with wordpress, lists them according to a predefined format, and uses wpscan to perform the scanning.

Nothing special, Just simple a list of multiple websites scanner with wpscan. If you're good with code, I'm sure you can implement more sophisticated automation (e.g. Telegram bots, automatic checks on deployment via the Asset Information Report API, etc), or if you're thinking about your own DAST, this can help you with the initial development design. 

If you want to extend it further, you could create an administrative web UI and create self-service checks on the web UI, so that you can perform checks on demand.

## Requirements
- Wpscan must be installed on your system.
- WordPress Vulnerability Database API token (you can get it from [here](https://wpscan.com/api))
- One or more websites developed with wordpress. 
- Telegram BOT Token

## How to write list file?
- it's very simple.
- url, name, telegram_chat-room_id
- If you change the Telegram chat ID in the third field, you can send the result to a different Telegram chat ID.
```
ex) list.txt
https://wordpress_site.com,WordPress Site.com,12345678910
https://not_wordpress_site.com,Not Wordpress Site.com,0938342323
https://no_exist_domain.com,no_exist_domain,-34382473434
```

## Features
- Multiprocessing to scan multiple websites at the same time.
- Send a summary of the scan results, logfile (in this tool, result will send to telegram, so you have to get a chat room)

## Limitations
It's important to note that this tool is not a replacement for manual testing, and it may not detect all vulnerabilities present in web applications. The tool should be used as a supplement to manual testing, and the results should be verified by a human tester before any action is taken. Additionally, the tool may produce false positives or false negatives, which should be considered when interpreting the results.

Overall, this tool can be a valuable addition to your web vulnerability testing process, helping you to identify and mitigate potential security risks in a large number of web applications.
